1. EventList management :: When there are multiple arrival events with the exact same time at the same node,
there should be a mechanism to decide which event goes in. Also, in the first place, there should be a mechanism
to find the Arrival events with those property in the EventList. 
One possible solution is to handle this in at the time of putting events in the EventList. This can be implemented
by having separate data structures for different kind of events. For instance, one for arrival events and one for 
departures and one for TCP-time-outs.

2. Queues and departure event :: Implementing queues without departure event is not logical. One could say we can create 
a mechanism in each queue
which updates the occupancy with every put in it. But I'm afraid such a system will impose more time complexity on the
program compared to having departure events.

3. Packet Drop :: when do packet drops happen?
a1- When multiple packets arrive at the same time to the same node.
a2- When one packet arrives before the transmission time the previous packet to the node is finished.
a3- When the occupancy of the corresponding link's buffer is full. (This case is certain.)
-- In general we can say the packet drop happens at two levels. First, upon arrival at the node. Second, inside the node at 
the links buffer.

4. The structure of buffer can be updated. Right now packets do not actually stay in the buffer queue. The wait-Time of each 
packet is determined by 
the buffer based on the wait_time of previous packets. This means at events, departure events are created upon arrival as 
opposed to be created upon
departure of earlier packets in the buffer.

5. ** There is an issue with the ACK flow label. In the current design, ACKs have the same label of the flow.
-- Solution: The source agent is called by flow.label+".ACK" and the ACK flow is called by the same new name. In this condition, 
there should no problem
ACK flow and Data flow.

1. How does TCP handle the timers?
	- Is there a timer for each segment sent from the sender? Or there is a aggregate timer mechanism?
	- What does TCP do with an ACK that has arrived after its timer is expired?
** The timer is working only for the oldest non-acknowledged segment. Hence the time-out should happen only for such acknowledge?
@ In GBN, whenever a timer is timed out, the sender will send the whole sending window starting from the timed-out segment

// Question:
	Where should I put the buffer entities?
		- an attribute of link
		- an element of a set of buffers in side a switch
	Where is the definition of links?
		- in the net entity
		- in the source node entity  
	Do we need to have actual link to controller?
	Do we need to have arrival to controller Event?
		- probably yes. Because it is possible that in the time the SYN segment is being sent to the controller
		  some other event happen in the network and updating the time to the
